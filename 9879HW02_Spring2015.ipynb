This suggests that we penalize any under fill of limit orders by $\\sigma\\,\\sqrt{T}$ where $T$ is the order duration.  Compute the corresponding value of $\\lambda_u$ in cents per share.\n\n\n(b) Assuming a spread of $1$ cent, what are $h$, $f$, and $r$ for BZX and BYX respectively (in cents per share)?\n\n\n(c) Assuming no seasonality, what is the mean value $\\bar \\xi$ of $\\xi$ (over 3.9 minutes) for BZX and BYX respectively (in shares)?\n\n\n(d)  Assume that $\\xi$ is log normally distributed with\n\n$$\n\\xi = \\bar \\xi \\,\\exp\\left\\{\\sigma\\,Z-\\frac 12\\,\\sigma^2\\right\\}.\n$$\n\nwhere $Z \\sim N(0,1)$ and $\\sigma = 1/2$.
